# ParametrizationSkeleton

## Introduction
ParametrizationSkeleton is an skeletonization appraoch for detecting beam like structures.
This software runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.
FeatureLineNet has been developed by Martin Denk and Prof. Dr. Rother Klemens at the [University of Applied Science Munich](https://www.hm.edu/) at the institute for material and building research.

This work is part of the project ANGORA, which is supported by the “Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy“ with the funding indicator ZF4428401BZ7 in the context of the research network IraSME and ZIM. Responsibility for the content of this publication lies with the authors.

	abstract = {Polygon meshes and particularly triangulated meshes can be used to describe the shape of different types of geometry such as bicycles, bridges, or runways. In engineering, such polygon meshes can be supplied as finite element meshes, resulting from topology optimization or from laser scanning. Especially from topology optimization with low member size settings, frame-like polygon meshes with slender parts are typical and often have to be converted into a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) format, e.g., for further geometrical detailing or performing additional shape optimization. Especially for such frame-like geometries, CAD designs are constructed as beams with cross-sections and beam-lines, whereby the cross-section is extruded along the beam-lines or beam skeleton. In our research, automatic parameterization of polygon meshes into a subdivision surface representation is tried out. For this purpose, the beam-lines are approximated by computation of curved skeletons, which are determined by a homotopic thinning method. These skeleton lines are transformed into a subdivision surface control grid by using the Euclidean distance transformation.},
